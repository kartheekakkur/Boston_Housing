## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices


### Data

The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

**Features**
1.  `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-teacher ratio by town

**Target Variable**
4. `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes

## Concepts and Classes

**Concepts explored in this project:**

1. Exploring Supervised Learning Regression algorithms Linear Regression, Decsion Tree Regression

2. Performance Metric R^2 Score for Linear Regression, accuracy scores

3. Shuffling and Splitting the Data in Training and Testing sets

4. Analyzing Model Performance- Learning Curves,  Bias-Variance Tradeoff

5. Evaluating Model Performance- Grid Search, K-Fold Cross Validation
